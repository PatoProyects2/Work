          RPS Games Club smart contract communicates with an off-chain service
          powered by ChainLink which ensures the randomness of the results and
          prevents the system from being exploited and hacked.The RPS Games Club
          smart contract will only accept the random number input if it has a
          valid cryptographic proof, and the cryptographic proof can only be
          generated if the VRF process is tamper-proof. This provides our users
          with automated and verifiable assurances directly on-chain that the
          randomness underlying RPS games is provably fair and was not tampered
          with by the oracle, outside entities, or the RPS team.

        <p className="lead py-3">
          After reviewing various solutions, we selected Chainlink VRF because
          itâ€™s based on cutting-edge academic research, supported by a
          time-tested oracle network, and secured through the generation and
          on-chain verification of cryptographic proofs that prove the integrity
          of each random number supplied to smart contracts.

          In our RPS game there are two possible outcomes: either you win or you
          lose. Our main principle is to build a fair and transparent system,
          where every game is completely randomized with 50% 50% odds. In order
          to fulfill one of our main premises (to be as transparent as
          possible), our house wallets will be of public access.
