It is usually played between two opponents; each player simultaneously selects one of three possible outcomes. These outcomes are \"rock\" ( a closed fist), \"paper\" (a flat hand), and \"scissors\" (a fist with the index and middle finger extended, forming a V). You have an unbiased 50% chance of winning, we do not contemplate draws. What side will you choose?",
